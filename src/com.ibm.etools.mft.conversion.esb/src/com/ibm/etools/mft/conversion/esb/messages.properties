todoUnsupportedPrimitive = In message flow ''{2}'', you must convert the {1} mediation primitive ''{0}'' manually. <br/><br/>The WebSphere ESB conversion tool converts a mediation primitive of type {1} into a subflow. The subflow that is created acts as a placeholder in your message flow. To manually convert this mediation primitive, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33081_.htm">Completing a to-do task for a mediation primitive converted as a subflow</a>. 
todoUnsupportedPrimitive_tableDesc = <br/><br/>The following table shows promoted properties, and properties with non-default values for this primitive. The values of properties that are selected in drop-down lists are shown as integer values, where 0 corresponds to the first entry in the list:
todoUnsupportedPrimitive_tableDescCustomMediation = <br/><br/>The following table shows promoted properties, and properties with non-default values for this primitive. The values of properties that are selected in drop-down lists are shown as integer values, where 0 corresponds to the first entry in the list. Java code entered as a property for this primitive might not be shown:


AbstractMediationPrimitiveConverter_ToDoTask=Replace the Passthrough node with one or more message flow nodes that can implement the functionality of the source mediation primitive.
#AbstractMediationPrimitiveConverter_ToDoTask=The WebSphere ESB conversion tool has not been able to convert your mediation primitive by using the custom primitive converter class that you have configured. <br/>A subflow has been created as a placeholder for your mediation primitive ''{0}'' in your message flow.  <br/>To manually convert this mediation primitive, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33081_.htm">Completing a to-do task for a mediation primitive converted as a subflow</a>.

#Message Element Setter mediation primitive
todoConvertMessageElementActions = The Message Element Setter mediation primitive ''{0}'' has been converted to the JavaCompute node ''{1}''. Manually convert the actions from the Message Element Setter primitive into Java code in the JavaCompute node ''{1}''. <br/><br/>You use a JavaCompute node to check and manipulate message content. For more information on the JavaCompute node, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ac20805_.htm">JavaCompute node</a>. <br/><br/>To learn about developing and writing Java code in IBM Integration Bus, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ac30200_.htm">Developing Java</a>. <br/><br/>To learn how to associate Java code with your JavaCompute node, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ac30240_.htm">Creating Java code for a JavaCompute node</a>.
#todoUnsupportedMessageElementPath = The Message Element Setter primitive ''{0}'' contains an unsupported message element path ''{1}''. The Message Element Setter primitive has been converted to the JavaCompute node ''{2}''. Manually convert the path in the Java associated with the JavaCompute node ''{2}''.
todoUnsupportedMessageElementPath = The Message Element Setter mediation primitive ''{0}'' contains an unsupported message element path ''{1}''. Manually convert the path in the Java associated with the JavaCompute node ''{2}''.

#Filter mediation primitive
todoDisableMessageFilter = The Message Filter primitive ''{0}'' is not enabled. The Message Filter primitive has been converted to the Route node ''{1}''. Manually disable the Route node ''{1}''.
todoUnsupportedPathInFilterPattern = Convert path ''{0}'' in the filters table in node ''{1}'' manually.

#Mapping mediation primitive

todoMapIsMissing = The map file ''{0}'' is missing from the source WebSphere ESB project. The Mapping node ''{1}'' cannot be configured automatically. <br/><br/>The XML map that needs to be configured in your Mapping node ''{1}'' is not available locally. You must identify the library project that contains the XML map and configure your Mapping node manually. <br/><br/>For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33086_.htm">Completing a to-do task for an XML map that is missing</a>.

#To-Do tasks related to bindings

todoConfigureUnsupportedBinding = Manually convert the binding that has the following implementation class: ''{0}''. <br/><br/> Optionally, you can create your own binding converter class to convert the export or import that has this binding configured and rerun the WebSphere ESB conversion tool. <br/><br/>In IBM Integration Bus, you use a message flow node to recreate an export or an import and its binding. To specify the parser that you want to use to serialize or deserialize your data, you configure the Message Domain property. To handle faults, you connect the Fault terminal of a node and implement its logic. For exports only, you must manually implement the function selector when the WebSphere ESB mediation module is converted into an application. <br/><br/>For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33087_.htm">Completing a to-do task for a binding that requires manual conversion</a>.
todoConfigureJMSTransport = Configure the JMS transport properties for node ''{0}''. For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ac56170_.htm">SOAPInput node</a>.
todoConfigureHTTPTransport = Configure the HTTP transport properties for node ''{0}''. For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc19328_htm">Generating an HTTP binding</a>.
###
todoAdvancedPropertiesOnSOAPBinding=The conversion tool cannot automatically configure the SOAP input node and the message flow based on following properties. Configure the SOAP Input node and the message flow manually. <br/> <br/> <ul> {0} </ul>

#To-Do tasks related to library conversion
todoSchemaProblems = Check that schema files in project ''{0}'' have been converted.
todoJavaProblems = Check that java in project ''{0}'' has been converted.

# To-Do tasks related to map conversion

todoPotentialErrorsOnMap = Fix any validation errors and warnings for map ''{0}''. <br/><br/>To resolve validation errors related with a missing input or output object in a map, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33085_.htm">Completing a to-do task to fix errors reported for a missing input or output object</a>.
todoXPath10DetectedInMap = Update map ''{0}'' to use XPath 2.0. For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33078_.htm">Completing a to-do task for XPath 1.0 expressions</a>. <br/><br/>You use XPath 2.0 to define XML maps properties, functions, and custom XPath expressions in IBM Integration Bus. However, in WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, you can choose to use XPath 2.0 or XPath 1.0. <br/><br/>IBM Integration Bus operates in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode set to false. <br/><br/>
mapTodoMapContextRelativePath = The map contains a {1} transform defined between an input and output element where one of them is a context element or a header element. The context element or the header element is ''{0}''. You must convert this transform manually. For more information, see <a href="/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bm33002_.htm">Completing the conversion of maps</a>. \n\nThe WebSphere ESB conversion tool converts automatically XML maps where mappings have been defined between the input and output body elements. All other mappings require manual conversion.
mapTodoMapHeader = The map contains a {0} transform of an SMO header element. You must manually convert this transform. \n\nThe WebSphere ESB conversion tool converts automatically XML maps where mappings have been defined between the input and output body elements. All other mappings require manual conversion.
mapTodoMapContext = The map contains a {0} transform of an SMO context element. You must manually convert this transform. \n\nThe WebSphere ESB conversion tool converts automatically XML maps where mappings have been defined between the input and output body elements.
